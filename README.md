## Hi there 👋

🎓 I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at ASU (graduating Dec 2025) with 2.5+ years of experience @ SAP Labs as Software Developer and am also the founder of Elevv, an AI-powered career intelligence platform. I’m passionate about building scalable, ML-driven products from the ground up.

🚀 As founder, I’ve designed, built, and deployed a full-stack, serverless application on AWS — architecting event-driven Python microservices for asynchronous resume processing and integrating LLMs for intelligent content generation. This hands-on journey has given me end-to-end experience across the product lifecycle, from system design to user adoption.

💻 Previously, I spent 2.5+ years at SAP Labs engineering distributed backend systems and ML automation pipelines. I led projects that cut order processing time by 90% and improved API performance by 30%. At ASU, my current research focuses on LLM compression and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

🛠️ Skills & Tools
Languages: Python, C++, Java, SQL, JavaScript
Frameworks/Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, React, Flask
AI/ML: Computer Vision, NLP, LLMs, RAG, YOLOv8, Optical Flow
Cloud & Databases: AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB), SAP Cloud, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

🔍 I’m actively seeking full-time Software Engineering opportunities starting late 2025 in distributed systems, backend engineering, Machine Learning and applied AI. Feel free to connect with me or reach out if you’d like to collaborate!
