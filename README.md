## Hi there 👋

My name is Veeresh Koliwad and I live in Tempe, Arizona, USA.

🎓I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University (graduating in December 2025), currently researching on LLM compression, and previously worked at SAP Labs for over 2.5 years, where I focused on backend development, distributed systems, and machine learning-driven systems.
.

💻I have been working in designing and implementing AI-driven solutions, particularly in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. My professional journey at SAP Labs as an Associative Software Developer allowed me to lead ML-driven automation, improved API performance by 30%, and built microservices that cut order processing time by 90%.

🛠️Skills: Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, JavaScript, SQL Libraries/Frameworks: PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, OpenCV, React Native AI Domains: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, LLMs Databases and Cloud Platforms: MySQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), AWS, Azure, SAP Cloud Platform

🚀 I am actively seeking Summer 2025 internship opportunities and full time roles starting Dec 2025 in Data Science, Machine Learning, NLP and Software Engineering roles. Feel free to connect with me or reach out if you’d like to collaborate! Email: vkoliwad@asu.edu
